Renewap is a platform designed to bridge the gap between waste materials generated daily and skilled artisans capable of transforming these waste materials into upcycled and repurposed products. The platform offers a centralized marketplace where scrap yard owners can provide tailored waste materials to artisans, facilitating a secure and efficient procurement process. Additionally, Renewap serves as an ecommerce hub, allowing artisans to showcase and sell their innovative recycled creations.

## Problem Statement

Millions of tons of household waste are generated daily, often collected by local scrap collectors and resold to larger markets. Simultaneously, skilled artisans possess the expertise to transform these waste materials into valuable products. However, a significant market gap exists: these artisans lack a secure, centralized platform to easily access and acquire the necessary raw materials for their creative projects. This gap hinders the potential for sustainable and creative recycling solutions.

## Solution Overview

"Renewap" aims to address this problem by providing a unified platform that connects scrap yard owners and artisans:

- **Materials Procurement:** Scrap yard owners can list waste materials on the platform, tailoring their offerings to the specific needs and requirements of artisans.
- **Secure Transactions:** The platform ensures secure transactions and a streamlined delivery process, facilitating the procurement of materials.
- **Artisan Showcase:** Artisans can register as sellers on the platform, presenting their innovative upcycled and repurposed products to a wider audience.
- **Ecommerce Marketplace:** Renewap serves as an ecommerce marketplace, enabling artisans to exhibit and sell their creations directly to interested buyers.

- Then run **"npm i"** command in each of the three terminals.
- Run command **"node index"** in the backend related terminal. It will show:<br>
    Server Started<br>
    Successful connection....
- Run command **"npm run dev"** in the frontend related terminal. It will give a link:<br>

- If you are a scrapyard holder you will be able to now add waste items here. Your wastes will be collected.
- If you are a community, you can view the store here about what types of wastes are currently available with us. You can buy wastes from there. You can also post your own created recycled products in this platform to sell it to any customer visiting here.

## Future Enhancements

- **Smart Material Recommendations**

**Idea:** Implement AI-powered recommendation systems that suggest suitable waste materials to artisans based on their past creations and preferences. Utilize data analytics to understand their preferences and needs.

**Why:** This idea can enhance user experience by helping artisans quickly find the materials they need, leading to increased efficiency in the creative process. AI-driven recommendations can lead to higher satisfaction and engagement, making the platform more valuable.

- **Predictive Demand Analysis**

**Idea:** Use Data Science to analyze historical data and predict demand for specific waste materials. This can help scrap yard owners stock materials more effectively, reducing waste and ensuring a steady supply for artisans.

**Why:** Predicting demand can lead to better inventory management, reducing costs and minimizing material wastage. Providing a steady supply of materials to artisans can improve their trust in the platform and encourage consistent engagement.

- **Automated Quality Inspection**

**Idea:** Employ computer vision and machine learning to automate the quality inspection of waste materials. This ensures that artisans receive materials meeting their required standards, reducing manual intervention.

**Why:** Ensuring consistent quality of materials is essential for artisans' success. Automated quality inspection can save time for both scrap yard owners and artisans, increasing reliability and reducing the chances of unsatisfactory purchases.

Each of these ideas brings practical value and innovation to your platform, addressing both user needs and sustainability goals. You can prioritize based on the resources available, potential impact, and alignment with your platform's mission.
